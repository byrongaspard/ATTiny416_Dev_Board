# ATTiny416_Sensor_Board

This project is my first attempt at embedded hardware/software design where I capture schematics, layout/route a custom PCB, and write software to test it all. In my senior design project and professional career, I have integrated Arduino and Raspberry Pi “like” development boards into custom solutions, but this is my first design creating an embedded design from scratch.

There we’re no real requirements or objectives with this design as the primary objective was to learn how to layout a PCB using KiCad. However, to make the design process a little more interesting than just an “Arduino”, I decided I wanted my board to have the following features:
